Ascension: Currency used to purchase upgrades
1. World
  stats:
    condition
    size (influences reproduction pace)
    
  condition changes (
		hot(deathrate reduced) 
		medium(average) 
		cold(deathrate increased))
 
2. Organisms
  live in the world and have various stats which affect behavior
  stats:
    reproduction time/delay
    production rate
    tier (which organisms can feed on which others)
    number of mates
    speed of movement
    probability for mutation on reproduction
    consumption rate for reproduction
    lifespan
    
3. Building that perform various tasks
  tasks:
    food storage
    organism stat changes globally:
      reproduction time
      production rate
      lifespan
      speed of movement

4. Science/Research
  upgrade mutation probability

#design
button to produce initial food
button to produce lowest stats organism


#implementation
1. core folder creation
2. index.html
3. main.js
World should be a class which includes a list of organisms
Organism should be a class which includes variables for each stat
  variables
    number reproductionTime
    number productionRate
    number tier
    number mates
    number speed
    number mutation
    number consumptionRate
